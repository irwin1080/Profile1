  <h3>About Me</h3>



    <p>
      My name is Irwin Dominguez I'm from Laverne, Oklahoma
      there's not really much going on in the town itself, but you
      eventually find something to keep yourself occupied.

      Some things that I like to do are to paint.
      The medium I use is mainly watercolor, just cause
      it's easy and relaxing to do. I also like hanging
      out with my friends especially my best friend
      (pictured above with me). Fun fact I
      also like to neglect my respnsibilities.
